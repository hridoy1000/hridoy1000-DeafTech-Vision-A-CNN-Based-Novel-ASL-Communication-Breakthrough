asl_digits_dataset: Contains a collection of images depicting American Sign Language (ASL) digits (0-9). Useful for training and testing ASL digit recognition models.

asl_alphabet_train_dataset: Consists of images representing various ASL alphabet signs. Ideal for training machine learning models to recognize individual ASL alphabet letters.

asl_alphabet_test_dataset: Comprises additional images of ASL alphabet signs, suitable for evaluating the performance of ASL recognition models.

The American Sign Language datasets used in this project are available on Kaggle. The alphabet dataset can be accessed https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet, while the digit dataset is available https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hridoy1000/asl-digit.

These datasets facilitate the development and assessment of ASL recognition systems, contributing to advancements in accessible communication technologies.
